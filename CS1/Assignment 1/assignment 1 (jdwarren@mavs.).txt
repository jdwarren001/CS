Question 1:
	Find the value for each of the following C++ expressions:	a. 30. + 10 – 15 / 2 
								a. 33. b. 60. c.2. d.30	b. 10 + 25. * 2
	c. 10 / 11 + 3. - 2 / 2	d. 24 * 5 / 4	
	
Question 2:
	You are asked to instruct a primary school child how to find the smallest
	of three numbers.  Using A, B and C to represent the three numbers, write
	instructions for the child to perform the task.


Given the numbers A, B, and C.
If A is less than B
	Keep A
	Otherwise, keep B
If C is less than number kept
	C is the least number
	Otherwise, number kept is least number

	
Question 3:
	At the top of this file, write a suitable comment block for the head of a
	program if you wrote one to perform the task in question 2.


Question 4:
	Find the value of each of the following expressions, or explain why it is not
	a valid expression.  Place the answer on the line following each part.
	(a) 9 - 5 - 4
								a. 0
	(b) 2 / 3 + 3 / 5
								b. 0
	(c) 9.0 / 2 / 5
								c. 0.9
	(d) 7 % 5 % 2
								d. 0
	(e) 25 * 1 / 2
								e. 12
	(f) 25 * 1.0 / 2
								f. 12.5
	(g) 25 * (1 / 2)
								g. 0	
	(h) ((12 + 3) / 2) / (8 - (5 + 1))
								h. 3
	(i) ((12 + 3) / 2) / (8 - 5 + 1)
								i. 1
	(j) (12 + 3 / 2) / (8 - 5 + 1)
								j. 3

Question 5:
	Write C++ expressions to compute the following.  Place the answer on the
	line following each part.
	(a) 7 + 3B - 7AC
							double A, B, C;
							cout << 7 + (3 * B) - (7 * A * C);

	(b) Five times the quantity m squared plus n squared divided by twice the difference 7 - m.
					double m, n;
					cout << 5 * ((m * m) + (n * n)) / (2 * (7 - m));
		

	(c) The radius of a circle whose area is A.

						#include <cmath>
						double A, r;
   						const double pi = 3.14159;
  						cout << "Area: ";
    						cin >> A;
    						r = sqrt(A / pi);
    						cout << r << endl << endl;


Question 6:
	Artillery tables have been a standard application of computers for the last
	couple of centuries.  (Computers were originally people who computed.)  These
	tables displayed the required angle of tilt of a cannon so that the projectile
	would achieve a certain distance, given initial muzzle velocity, wind speed, 
	temperature, humidity, . . .
	
	Consider a simplified situation where initial velocity is the only parameter.
	Thus the table need only display distance covered for specified tilt angle.
	
	A C++ program has been written to calculate the distance, given the initial
	velocity and various angles.  The programmer, however, couldn't remember his
	high school physics.  He left out the statement for calculating the vertical
	distance covered in a certain number of seconds.  The formula is given on the
	assignment sheet, with
		s being the distance
		u the initial vertical velocity
		t the time since firing
		g gravity.
		
	Look at the program, especially the variable names used by the programmer, and
	type in the C++ statement needed.
	
	You want the missile to land as close as possible to 600 metres away.
	Run the program to find the correct angle and the duration of the flight of the
	projectile given a specific initial velocity determined from your student number.
	If your number starts with 2, take the first four digits and divide it by 25 - or
	multiply by 4 and divide by 100 (so for example 2123456 would become 84.92) and
	for those students with numbers starting with 9 just divide by 100 (e.g. student 
	number 9512345 uses 95.12)

	Place the answer you determine here.
	
						My number was odd, so I 								did 7004/100= 70.04 mph at a 45 degrees. 						500.47 meters travelled in 10.1052 							seconds was my maximum potential distance.
