# Programming Languages Notes

### <u>Elements of Prorgamming Languages:</u>
- Syntax
- Structure
- Semantics
- Data
- Assigment Statement
- Type Checking
- Control Statements
- Subprograms

<u>Programming Environment</u>
- Compiler
- Linker
- Editor
- Library
- Loader
- Debugger
- Profiler
- Testing tools
  - Things like error messages (<b>Tracers</b>)
  - Milestone checks w/ debugger
  - Concept: Reachability, Infection, Propagation (RIP)
- Config tools
- Interperter

<u>Elementary Types</u>: ints, bool, char, etc.

<u>Composite Types</u>: Arrays, records

<u>Control Structures:</u>
- if
- loops
- switch/case

<u>Subprograms:</u>
- Parameters and parameter passing
- Procedures and functions
- Recursion
- Stacks

# Languages

- JavaScript
- Swift - IOS programming language 
- TypeScript - Subset of JS, a build on of JS for static typing. 
- "GO" - Solves issues with Google and its operations. Very similar to "C", but designed with more saftey, garbage collection, structural typing.
- SQL - A database software extension. Grabs info to visualize, make calculations, etc.
- Ruby - An objected oriented designated language. 
- R - Data science and analysis language. Also statistical computing. 
- PHP - Hypertext processor

<u>Programming Paradigm</u>: General coding languages
  - Three Types:
    - Procedural: Based on repeatable procedures (follow procedures/instructions)
    - Scripting: Interperated while running, rather than before hand
    - Functional: Programming split up using functions

<u>Type Checking</u>: 
  - Two types:
    - Static: Type checking occurs <b>at compile</b>, vars bound to type and value
      - C, C++, Java
    - Dynamic: Type checking occurs <b> at runtime</b>, vars can switch types
      - Python, perl, ruby

<u>Type Conversion</u>: Allows conversion of type without explicit mention
  - Two types:
    - Allow: Allows conversions <b>(Implicit)</b>
      - C, C++, JS
    - Disallow: Does not allow conversions <b>(Explicit)</b>
      - Java, Python, Ruby
  - Problems: Create type confusion
    - ex: "5" + 2 = 52 in JS, perl, coffeescript
    - = 7 in php
    - Java and python dont allow implicit conversion

<u>Memory Class</u>: Requires memory managment
  - Managed: other
  - Unmanaged: C, C++

# Final
- Why learning new programming languages?
- 3 parts of a programming language:
  - Syntax
  - Structure
  - Semantics
- What are programming languages and what are they used for?
- Object oriented languages (4 parts):
  - Classes + encapcilation
  - Polymorphism -> Capable of adapting to new situations/inputs
  - Inheritance -> Diff. objects all share common features 
  - Exceptions -> Catches errors
- What is a program? -> Instructions to be caried out
- Rule of standardization: Do we have to modernize?
- 2 concepts of algorithms:
  - Spacial -> Memory
  - Temporal -> How fast
- Compiler vs interperter
  - Compiles -> takes it all and compiles it
  - Interpereter -> Goes line by line
- Diff types of applications: Firmware, mobile, web, data oriented
- Why pick a lang? -> Workplace only knows certian ones, maintenance, security, testability
- Data oriented languages
- Risc and Cisc:
  - Reduced instruction set: Only a few pieces make a lot happen
  - Complex instruction set: Complete instructions for a few purposes
- Value: An assigned value
- Literal: Base value (int, bool)
- Representation: 
- Object: Composite
- Programming eniv:
  - Compiler
  - Development tools (Debugger)
